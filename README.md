This was a project done for Lambda School, using React, Redux, JS, HTML, CSS.

Since I had lived in Toronto for a while, and at a time before mobile data was affordable.
I remember when the TTC released their first app, and it was awful.
Things have changed since then, but I wanted to try to recreate a better application.

This application hits an API, gttps://myttc.ca/, pushes through a station name, and returns the next two bus times for each line serviced by that stop.

This was written in a single night, and currently only works with a single station, davisville, but I I am working on revisiting this app in the future.
